# Bullet Journal App (Bujo Projects)

This is a simple Bullet Journal application project designed to provide basic logging, future planning, and review functionalities. The project includes two versions:

1.  **`bujo_gui`**: A Graphical User Interface (GUI) version developed using C++ and the Qt framework.
2.  **`bujo_cmd`**: A Command-Line Interface (CLI) version written in C++.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **General**:
    * C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
* **`bujo_gui` Specific**:
    * CMake (Version 3.16 or higher)
    * Qt Development Libraries (Qt 5.x or Qt 6.x) - Ensure the `Widgets` module is installed.

### Building

#### Building `bujo_gui` (GUI Version)

```bash
# Navigate to the GUI project directory
cd bujo_gui

# Create and enter the build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Run CMake configuration
# You might need to specify the Qt path if it's not found automatically
# e.g., cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/your/qt
cmake ..

# Run the build
make
# or use: cmake --build .

#### Building `bujo_cmd` (CLI Version)

```bash
# Navigate to the CLI project directory
cd bujo_cmd

# Compile using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
g++ main.cpp -o bujo_cmd -std=c++17

### Running

* **`bujo_gui`**:
    * After building, the executable is typically located in the `bujo_gui/build/` directory.
    * On Linux/macOS, run `./fg` (based on the project name in CMakeLists.txt).
    * On Windows, run `fg.exe`.
* **`bujo_cmd`**:
    * After building, the executable is located in the `bujo_cmd/` directory.
    * On Linux/macOS, run `./bujo_cmd`.
    * On Windows, run `bujo_cmd.exe`.
    * The program will display a menu; follow the prompts to operate.

## üíæ Data Storage

* **`bujo_cmd`**: By default, saves data to a `journal.txt` file in the same directory as the executable.
* **`bujo_gui`**: By default, uses the "Open" and "Save" menu options to let the user choose a JSON file for loading and saving data.

**Note**: If you do not want to commit your personal journal content to version control (e.g., Git), it is recommended to add the data files (`journal.txt`, `*.json`) to your `.gitignore` file.
